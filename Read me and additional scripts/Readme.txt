Current problems
Scripts are not loading current error is Cannot find variable "Gpu1" mm_mining_rig/scripts/4_World/entities\itembase\mm_mining_rig\land_mm_mining_rig.c(67): Can't find variable 'Gpu1'
i will provide the latest script error log i have for this, a few other errors in the scripts all seem to be relating to how im calling the attachments. Im assuming this is incorrect and will probably need redoing. (You will probs spot the issues straight away and just laugh xD)
Textures for gpu and rig need sorting and holo and kit need setting up correctly.(I can sort these if needed i have just been putting my time in to the mining rig script itself).
